# Nawyish - Web

## Description

This is the web app for the Nawyish project. It is built with React and uses Next.js to manage the build process.
It consists of two pages: the apartments listing page and the apartment details page. The listing page is the default page and shows a list of apartments. The details page is accessed by clicking on an apartment in the listing page and shows the details of the selected apartment.

Of course, there's no auth because I don't wanna :(

## Installation

Run `npm ci` to install the necessary dependencies.

## Usage

Run `npm run dev` to start the app. If you're running things properly, port `3000` should be taken by the backend, so the frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3001`. If you're running the docker setup, as I asked you (begged almost), then the frontend will be available at `http://localhost:4000`.
